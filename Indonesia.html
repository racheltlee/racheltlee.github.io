        <p>Indonesia is an archipelago made of over 13,000 islands. Spanning 3,200 miles wide, Indonesia's population is extremely diverse in its local and regional languages and cultures. It is the forth most populous country in the world and a majority Muslim population. Despite its population size, Indonesia is the second most forested region in the world and home to the endangered Orangutan species.</p>
        <h2>The Political History of Indonesia</h2>
        <p>Even within the complicated sphere of Southeast Asian politics, ethnic strife and authoritarian rule pervades Indonesia's political history.</p> 
        <p>Indonesia gained its independence from Japan in 1945, following Japan's loss in World War II. Leading the country was Sukarno, who solidified power through <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided_Democracy_in_Indonesia>"guided democracy"</a> and reinstated a more centralized version of Indonesia's constitution. Backed by China and the Soviet Union, Sukarno pushed Indonesia's government politically left but angered many members of his military in the process. In 1965, six high ranking military officials were suddenly murdered in the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_September_Movement>"September 30 Movement"</a>, triggering a purge of communists across the country by Indonesia's military and anti-communists. With rampant instablity and violence, Sukarno's officials replaced a politically weakened Sukarno with General Suharto.</p>
        <p>From 1966 to 1998, Suharto consolidated the economy and his power under the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Order_(Indonesia)>"New Order"</a>. Suharto developed the Golkar system, which created powerless oppositional parties, and absorbed the military into the government. The Suharto government was characterized by unbridled corruption; family members were awarded high ranking board positions and contracts while the military targeted political and military enemies. In return, Suharto promised to industrialize and grow Indonesia's economy. Suharto's grip on power maintained until 1997, when the Asian Financial Crisis hit. Millions were devastated and blamed Suharto for corruption in the government and across Indonesia. Suharto was then forced the step down on May 21, 1998.</p>
        <p>In June 1999, Indonesia held its first competitive elections since independence. Abdurrahman Wahid, a respected Muslim cleric, rose to Presidency with the idea that Islam could only thrive through democracy. However, government corruption forced Wahid to step down in 2001. Megawati Sukarnoputri, the eldest daugher of Sukarno, held power until 2004, where she lost the election to Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. July 2014, two new candidates emerged on the political stage: Joko "Jokowi" Widodo, running on a platform of reform and diversity, and Prabowo Subianto, called by many "the Vladimir Putin of Indonesia" and married to Suharto's daughter. Jokowi, seen as a champion of the masses and outside of the political elite, won the 2014 election and later another five-year term in 2019. However, Jokowi's recent illiberal policies have stunned many of his former supporters and many fear that Indonesia could be sliding back toward corruption and strong-man rule.</p>
